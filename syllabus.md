##Tentative Syllabus

The course is based on this [textbook](http://www.recursivebooks.com): 
Operating Systems: Principles and Practice, Tom Anderson and Mike Dahlin. 
You do not need the second edition. I only have the beta edition still.

All chapters listed below and lab exercises 1-7 are syllabus. 
I will notify of any changes that may arise.
