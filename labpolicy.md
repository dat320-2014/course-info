##Lab Policy for DAT320 Operating Systems

###Grading and Collaboration Policy
All the lab exercises must be completed to satisfaction (passed) in order to sit for the exam. 

The final exam accounts for 60 % of the final grade in the course, while the lab grade accounts for the remaining 40 %. For the graded part of the lab, you will be given a grade in the range 0-100 points, which will be translated to a letter grade in the end, after the lab exam.

####Labs 1 - 5:
The first five lab handins are mainly preparatory, and doing a good job on these is important for the remaining part of lab. They must be completed *individually*. We do encourage collaboration on learning the material, e.g. pointing each other in the right direction and giving hints and tips, but *we do not accept joint handins* on these first five labs. You may discuss the assignments with others, but you may not copy answers or code from another student or make your code available to others. These labs will *not be graded*, but must be completed to at least the level of passing (>60 points per lab). You will not be told your grade points, only pass/fail.

####Labs 6 - 7:
The last two lab handins will be a larger project which will require a significant amount of work. We students to form groups and work together on these lab handins. For these lab handins the passing level will also be $>60$ points per lab. We will evaluate each handin separately and give the group a joint grade per lab. The final lab grade will be determined by the oral examination/demo in the lab. The oral exam will be conducted individually.

Any form of cheating, plagiarism, i.e. copying of another student's text or source code, will result in the grade *F*, and may be reported to the faculty for administrative processing. Committing acts that violate Student Conduct policies that result in course disruption are cause for suspension or dismissal from the University of Stavanger.

*Don't cheat. It's not worth it!*

###Slip Days
We have frequent lab handins in this course and to add some flexibility to your schedule, we have adopted a scheme with *slip days*. This means that if you cannot make a handin deadline, e.g. due to illness, resit exams, or other conflicting deadlines, you can use up to a total of **five slip days** throughout the semester for free. Weekends and holidays are included in the slip day counting.

Slip days beyond the *five free days* will count negatively towards your lab grade. For each extra slip day used, your grade is reduced by 5 points.

###Resubmission
If any of the submitted lab handins are below passing level, you will be granted **one resubmission** per handin. Your grade will be reduced by

* 5 points for the first resubmission
* 10 points for the second resubmission
* 20 points for the third resubmission

A fourth resubmission will not be allowed, resulting in failing the lab.
