##Lab Exam Procedure

We will be organizing lab exams in this course (as was presented at the start of the course). 

The lab exam will be held in Week XX. Exact day and time will be provided in a separate schedule.
 
1. Examination is individual and covers only lab 6 and 7. 
2. It is meant to be a demo session, where you show that your joint lab is working,
   and you will be asked to run different parts of the program(s) that you have developed,
   and we will also ask questions about the code.
3. Students are expected to know and be able to explain all the code in the relevant lab exercises,
   even though your group partner wrote that particular piece of code.
4. Your individual lab grade will be based on the lab handin and the lab exam.
5. Your grade will be announced at a later time after all students have completed their lab exam.
 
The procedure for the lab exam is as follows:
 
1. You are expected to come to the lab between 0700-0800 in morning of your exam date to set up
  the necessary terminal windows and otherwise prepare things so that each lab exercise can be
  executed with a few keystrokes. Make sure to test that all is working correctly. Nothing should
  be running when you leave the lab before 0800. Lock the screen and leave the room.
 
2. Please arrive about five minutes before your scheduled time and wait outside the lab.
  We will come and fetch you when it is your time.
 
3. The examination is expected to take 15-20 minutes.
 
4. You will be asked questions about:
- Your design and implementation for the two labs.
- General theory questions about the two labs.
- Questions about Go programming language features used in the labs.
- General questions about kernel programming.
